# VIVAESTUDIO
This is the **vivaestudio website**
You can see the demo website from here: https://agigox.github.io/vivaestudio/

## End goal
- Blazing fast website
- Well optimized for on-site SEO (I will request specifics)
- Developer friendly, easy to maintain and expand

## Feature requests
- Live browser reload after code changes
- Want to write CSS in SCSS. Needs to be compiled, autoprefixed and minified
- Then critical CSS needs to be extracted and injected in compiled html. My current gulpfile.js does that.
Minify and combine JS. I would be happy to use jQuery
- Create a SVG sprite that will contain all icons
- Webfont generator from a .ttf file (export woff and woff2)
- Optimize images (JPG, PNG, GIF, SVG). Possibly convert JPG to WebP in the future and generate @2x and @1x images
- Favicon generator: generate and name different favicon and touch-icon and move to root destination folder
- Move root files to destination root folder: for robots.txt, htaccess, etc
- Site will have pretty permalinks and a sitemap.xml will be generated from all URLs in the site
- About the resulting HTML, it needs to be minified and include the injected CSS
- How will markup be added to the site? I am very fluent with HTML5 but never coded a site with React, would love that you add some basic examples: variables, text strings, include partial files, link to other page of the site, add images...
- Multilanguage support
